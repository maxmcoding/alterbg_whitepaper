Within this world your fight is rewarded by the [Citadel](../temario/citadel.md), which will award credits to all participants in its defense. Get the highest daily score and thus win better prizes

### Defense missions

When a character enlists to defend the Citadel from Creature Hours, he must be prepared for an intense fight that will increase in difficulty throughout each battle. It will be helpful to bring the best equipment and ammunition to the battlefield.

The main mission (may vary) consists of defending certain critical points of the city, which if successful, this will add scores in favor of the character, however when these points fail they will be eliminated

When a character is fulfilling some of the missions, he must face multiple creatures which attack in waves, leaving a lapse of time between waves to heal wounds and replenish ammunition. At the end of each battle, the combat log will be saved and the Citadel will list you in the top of the most effective fighters.
