### Capitalization Wheel

In the AlterBg team and with the support of expert economists, we have defined a Fractional operability plan that allows the financial structure of this project to generate an endogenous liquidity circuit from InGame transactions.

This circuit is highly influenced by the trends of social interactions in the online world, since as in other great titles, Altered BG is a completely Online world in real time in which, the interaction with the other members of the community, will encourage the acquisition and consumption of tradable items for the entertainment and display of customized characters. That is why in all transactions carried out within the playable environment, the majority of the Fee will be provided for the repurchase and continuous injection of liquidity to the AlterBg token.

For example, these are some of the most notable features of liquid injection:

* In the Market, all transactions carried out in BUSD or USDT, have a commission of 5%, of which 50% destined to inject liquidity to the token and 50% to cover operating expenses
* With the Engineer, 50% of the value of the NFT token will be used for the injection of liquidity , the remaining 50% covers operating expenses and special events of the game
* Elite PVP duels with registration price have a commission of 10% of the total paid, destined to inject liquidity and operating costs in varying percentage; the remaining 90% is awarded to the winning team
* The Cost of repairing Items will be allocated to liquidity and Operational costs (% varied)
* Other transactional Events will apply the same business logic

### Price Oracle

In correlation with the above, transactions within the playable environment based on the AlterBg token, have a price regulated according to the BUSD referential value, for which there will always be a price balance regardless of the Token's referential value.
