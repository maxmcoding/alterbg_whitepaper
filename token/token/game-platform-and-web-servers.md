# Platform Fund

This fund will be initially managed by the development team in order to maintain and grow the infrastructure of the services and the structure of the platform.

Since our infrastructure is based on cloud services in order to guarantee greater control of data and avoid any type of alteration in the gameplay, the team will have these funds to pay for the monthly payments of Amazon Web Services.

To preserve the integrity of the funds, the team will prepare an annual expense report with a high degree of detail
