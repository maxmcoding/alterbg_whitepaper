Characters are classified in the same way as item types, that is, with various [rarities](rareza-de-objetos.md). All characters start with level 1 and 100 health, but as they progress through the levels, some stats gradually increase according to the [Rarity ](rareza-de-objetos.md)of the same.

The advantage of rarity in the characters mainly influences in PvE combats, in these combats the damage inflicted on creatures increases according to the effectiveness of the character and the items equipped on it. For PVP fights the advantage according to the rarity of the character only affects a small increase in damage resistance.
