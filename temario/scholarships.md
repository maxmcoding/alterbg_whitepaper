# Scholarships

As each investor can acquire a large number of characters, which could become difficult to manage; We want to promote a new scholarship system, in which we will be the interaction intermediaries, promoting trust and fair distribution of effort.

They all feature a basic character with simple stats and minimal level weaponry. But those who manage to stock up with multiple characters of great statistical value and equipment, can list them as "idle character" in the Characters section, which will allow anyone to reserve for a couple of hours and play with him in any activity within the game. All the profits obtained (with the exception of the [Items](diagramas.md)) during this time will be divided equally between both accounts, being 50% for the player and 50% for the investor.

More information will be released in the open beta
