# Weapons

![](<../.gitbook/assets/weapons (1).png>)

Weapons can be obtained by researching a [diagram ](diagramas.md)with the Citadel [Engineer](ingeniero.md), and their main characteristics will be determined by the rarity of the origin diagram. The main [characteristics ](tipos-de-articulos.md#attributes)of a weapon will increase the damage inflicted on creatures and characters in different ways, with [rarity ](rareza-de-objetos.md)being the main attribute that will multiply the damage inflicted on creatures; while the damage inflicted on the characters will only depend on the base power and the precision of the weapon.
