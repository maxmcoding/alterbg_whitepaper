When you create a new account, you are assigned a character, 2 random [weapons ](armas.md)with their respective random abilities, and an Item with a random ability. As you progress through the daily competitions, you can win some random scrolls.

For example, if you win a weapon scroll, depending on the [rarity](rareza-de-objetos.md), it will include a random ability. The same happens with Items.

You can see more details in[ NFT types](tipos-de-articulos.md)
